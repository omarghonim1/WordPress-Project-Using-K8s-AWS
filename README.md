Cluster Setup üõ†Ô∏è

- Created 3 VMs (1 Master + 2 Worker nodes).

- Installed Kubernetes using kubeadm.

- Configured CNI plugin for networking.

Installed AWS CSI Drivers:

- EBS CSI Driver ‚Üí used for MySQL database storage (block storage).

- EFS CSI Driver ‚Üí used for WordPress persistent files (shared storage).

- Created an IAM User and added its Access Key & Secret Key as a Secret inside the cluster.

- Created an IAM Role and attached the following policies:

- mazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy

- AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPullOnly

- Custom policy for EFS access.

- Attached the IAM Role to the EC2 instances to allow pods to interact with AWS services securely.

How To Access 

- WordPress was exposed using a **Kubernetes Service (LoadBalancer type)**.  
- This automatically provisioned an **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.  
- The ELB forwards traffic from the Internet to the WordPress pods running inside the cluster.  
- To access the WordPress site, copy the **DNS name of the AWS Load Balancer** from the AWS Management Console and open it in your browser.
