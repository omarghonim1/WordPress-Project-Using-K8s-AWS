Installed AWS CSI Drivers:

How To Access 

- WordPress was exposed using a **Kubernetes Service (LoadBalancer type)**.  
- This automatically provisioned an **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.  
- The ELB forwards traffic from the Internet to the WordPress pods running inside the cluster.  
- To access the WordPress site, copy the **DNS name of the AWS Load Balancer** from the AWS Management Console and open it in your browser.
